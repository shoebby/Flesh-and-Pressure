    d_t "I've been waiting here for a while now... We said 8 PM right? It's already 8:13 and she isn't responding to any texts..."
    d_t "Ugh, I'm gonna leave if she doesn't show up in like-"
    d_t "Oh, there she is."
    d_t "Wow her hair is -very- bright orange."

    nvl clear

    f "Hi!!! Ahh sorry I'm late some stuff came up it was really annoying I'm really sorry..."

    d_t "Is she wearing her work uniform?"

    d "Is that-"

    f "Ahahaha yeahhh it's my work uniform, I didn't have any time to go home and change after my shift and I figured I didn't want to be even later..."

    d "Couldn't you just change at work?"

    f "..."

    f "Scary..."

    d_t "This girl is a mess. No deal breakers yet though... She's pretty cute and good at texting, so maybe she just needs a bit to open up?"

    f "... L-let's go midgetgolfing!!!"

    d_t "Eugh why does she insist on calling it that, isn't it kinda ableist?"
    d_t "When she suggested it I figured might as well, but of all things, minigolf? Why minigolf?"
    d_t "Maybe she's really good and wants to show off, or something...?"

    f "I'll go get the clubs and ball! Be right back!"

    nvl clear

    d_t "She has this very clumsy way of walking, I'm kind of constantly worried she'll fall over or bump into something."
    d_t "Looking inside the hall it's packed with kids and their parents."
    d_t "The fluorescent colours of the tracks peer out from the darkened space like bioluminescent sea life."
    d_t "Actually, the overarching theme here seems to be a mix of pirates -and- sea life."
    d_t "Vivid corals, skull flags, a sunken ship..."
    d_t "It's charming, but I kinda wish we could've just went out for dinner or something. I could fuck up a burger right no-{nw}"

    f "Heya, here you go! I also got a little booklet for tracking our scores if you care for it..."

    d "Ah! Yeah, thanks. I'm not very competitive though so I'm fine with leaving that aside-"

    d_t "She's staring at me like I burned down an orphanage."

    nvl clear

    d_t "Did I say something wrong? Please don't tell me she's super competitive or something."

    d "Is... Something up?"

    f "Ah! No, sorry. I guess I'm just not used to someone... Uhm... Not wanting to... Uh... Compete..."

    d_t "Just -what- happened to this girl? Her entire demeanor turned into that of a wounded fawn."
    d_t "I'm getting a bit... concerned... But Stella told me she fucks good."
    d_t "I gotta push through."

    f "M-mwee..."

    d_t "Deer sounds???"

    f "O-okay... Well, let's play!"

    d_t "We make our way to the first hole, it's quite straight forward, just need to knock the ball into the corner to have it bounce towards the hole."
    d_t "She lets me go first and I sink it in two swings. Nice!"

    nvl clear

    f "Nice one! Ehe, okay, my turn!"

    d_t "Swing. Miss."
    d_t "Swing. Miss."
    d_t "Swing. Hit. Out of bounds."
    d_t "Swing. Miss."
    d_t "Swing Hit. Out of bounds."
    d_t "Swing Hit. Bounce."
    d_t "Swing. Miss."
    d_t "Swing. Miss."
    d_t "Swing. Hit. Slightly closer."
    d_t "Swing. Hit. Slightly closer."
    d_t "Swing. Hit. Sunk."
    d_t "Oh my god."
    d_t "She is -terrible- at this."

    nvl clear

    f "Hah... Hah... Nice... New record!"

    d_t "She does this regularly enough to have personal records?"
    d_t "How is she sweating and panting from this?"
    d_t "Why did she wet her finger to check the wind's direction inside of a glow-in-the-dark minigolf hall?"
    d_t "... Am I willing to go through with this for girldick?"

    nvl clear

    f "Okay... Hah... Onto the next one...!"

    d_t "My standards are shot."
    d_t "This one's more of the same but now with two corners."
    d_t "I take 3 swings and she only has 3 misses so far."
    d_t "She got pretty far but a clumsy hit accidentally knocks the ball out of bounds."
    d_t "She goes to pick it up and put it back..."
    d_t "All the way at the start..."

    nvl clear

    d "Hey you can just put it where you left off!"

    f "Gweh? But the rules say..."

    d_t "There's rules in minigolf?"

    d "Mhh it's fine, really, this doesn't seem fu-"

    f "But I need to follow the rules!"

    d_t "Oh. Okay. Wow. Chill out, just let her uh, do her thing?"

    f "Need to... Can't cheat..."

    d_t "Is girldick really worth this torture?"

    nvl clear

    d "G-good job!"

    f "..."

    d_t "Yikes."
    d_t "The next hole is a lot more straight-forward, just a bit wiggly."
    d_t "It gives us space to talk for a bit and I find out she used to play a lot of minigolf with 'someone important to her'."
    d_t "I'm not stupid so it's pretty obvious she means either an ex or a mom who either disowned her or died."

    f "-Y-yeah she was really sweet, just a bit uh... Too competitive... And, uh... Rough..."

    d_t "... I really hope it's an ex."
    d_t "Whatever's the case, she should not be dating."

    nvl clear

    d_t "After she finished up (5 misses, 3 out of bounds, 5 or 6 swings) we move on to the next hole, and this one is a lot more nerve-racking."
    d_t "It's two areas separated by a loop-de-loop, at the center of which lies a treasure chest prop filled to the brim with glittering coins."
    d_t "I manage to sink it in 5 swings, it's kind of tricky to gauge how hard you should hit the ball to complete the loop, but it's not impossible."
    d_t "I only now realize that neither she nor I have been doing any flirting like we did over text."
    d_t "I guess that, seeing her like this, I struggle to view her in any romantic or sexual light."
    d_t "100\% she would cry during sex, maybe before and after as well."
    d_t "Yeah... This is definitely not turning into a second date, but I at least want to make sure she's gonna be doing... fine..."

    nvl clear

    d "Hey um... Itske?"

    f "Yeap?"

    d "I've been thinking and... It's been fun! But I don't think I'm feeling much for a second date."
    d "I'd love to continue playing but I just wanted you to know, ok?"

    d_t "It's like a tiny rain cloud materialized right above her head and started pouring rain by the gallon."
    d_t "Near-instantly she's completely deflated, all her volume lost like a sopping wet cat."
    d_t "Seeing her limply hold that golf club, in that uniform as well, that tired look in her eyes..."
    d_t "I really hope this girl gets the help she probably..."
    d_t "No..."
    d_t "-Definitely- needs."

    nvl clear

    f "O-oh... Okay, well, can we be um, friends at least then?"

    d "Y-yeah of course!"

    d_t "Fuck."
    d_t "Why did I stammer there."
    d_t "It's like pulling an arrow, but instead of it coming out clean its barbs catch hunks of flesh."
    d_t "I'm so sorry, please please please don't cry."

    f "... O-okay well... sniff... Here I gooo..."

    d "Um, if you want we can skip this one, it's pretty hard."

    f "H-heh... Don't worry... My personal best on this one isn't even in the double digits..."
    f "..."
    f "... You won't be stuck with me for much longer."
