#
# Thanks for downloading my Automatic Speech Pauses plugin for Ren'Py! ( https://brunoais.itch.io/renpy-speech-pauses )
#
# Now, all you need to do is adjust the pause lengths below to your liking and (optionally) add new settings to
# your preferences screen to leave the choice up to the player!
#
# If you like this tool, consider dropping a donation: https://github.com/sponsors/brunoais?frequency=one-time
# Credit to "brunoais" and "KigyoDev" (the original author) would also be appreciated!
# "KigyoDev"'s version can be accessed here: https://kigyo.itch.io/speech-pauses-for-renpy
#
# Credit is due to KigyoDev for the initial idea and solution which allowed me to make this version much more
# easily. Also for accepting me copying the way he formats comments to make this tool more understandable for you.
# Without his work, I wouldn't have done this. Specially not this easily and fast. Thank you.
#
# Thank you and have fun! :D

    #       However, you can temporarily test and tune them, by replacing `default` with `$`, but remember to undo that later.
    # Warning: if "Text speed" setting is maxed, relative pauses have no effect because the pausing time will be effectively 0.
