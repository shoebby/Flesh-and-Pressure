    p "Do you like me?"

    f "W-whuh!!!"

    f_t "I stumble and turn but there's no one behind me. I could've sworn I heard a voice and yet..."

    p "Up here silly."

    f_t "I look up through the metal grating of the emergency exit's walkway and see someone standing right above me."
    f_t "It's hard to make her face out but I can see black dress shoes, long legs dressed in sleek gray trousers, and cobalt blue strands of hair flicking about in the wind..."

    f "M-ma'am? This area is off limits for custo- uh... Visitors."

    p "Oh, don't worry. I also work here!"

    f "You do...?"

    f_t "Bullshit, I've never seen her. She's not even wearing one of these stupid uniforms."

    nvl clear

    p "I mean... Come on..."

    f_t "She steps down the ringing metal stairs..."

    p "You've been touching me..."

    f_t "She's... Taller than I thought..."

    p "Grinding up against me..."

    f_t "P-pretty..."

    p "Using me..."

    f "Y-you're..."

    f_t "She leans against her machine self comfortably. She smiles warmly, maternally... Coyly."

    f "Piper?"

    nvl clear

    p "That's right dear! In the flesh, you think I wouldn't hear the things you whispered under your breath whenever you operate me?"
    p "What's it been like, 6 months now already?"

    f "Ohhh... Please don't remind me."

    f_t "She lets out a soft chuckle. It falls nicely on the ears, it kinda reminds me of mom."
    f_t "Guhhh..."

    p "It's okay dear, I don't mind. Really."
    p "If anything its been nice to finally have someone be so... Excited... About working with me."

    f "I guess you could call it that..."

    p "I mean, usually people just use me begrudgingly. I'm pretty sure they pull straws to decide who has to work with me."

    f_t "She's not wrong, I'm definitely the only one here who likes to work with her."
    f_t "Maybe a bit too much, but that's neither here nor there."

    nvl clear

    f "Well... I'm glad you like it. Things have been rocky lately, so it's nice to... uhm..."
    f "Feel... appreciated..."

    f_t "Piper's smile widens to a grin. Did she enjoy that comment? What is this reaction?"

    p "Of course, you work so hard. Don't people acknowledge that?"

    f "Well... Not really, no. It's like my mess-ups are the only ones that ever count."
    f "It doesn't matter how many people I help, make smile, give joy to, it's all rendered pointless when I..."

    p "When you mess up?"

    f "Yeah..."

    p "Is it such an unavoidable thing?"

    f "Maybe, I don't know, I think so. I can't keep it up forever, eventually I'll have a moment where I..."
    f "..."
    f "A moment where I'll either collapse in on myself, or explode on someone."

    p "People all have their limits don't they?"

    f "Yeah, but mine just happens to be a lot lower than most people's..."

    p "You poor thing..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "I can't help but feel nervous, she has this air about her, a pressure holding me down and making it hard to stay coherent."
    f_t "Like she has me exactly where she wants me."
    f_t "She really is like mom, but rather than a scolding it feels like..."

    p "A hug?"

    f_t "Before I could gather my thoughts her arms extend outwards and her long elegant fingers splay out, inviting me into her embrace."

    p "You... Look like you need it."

    f_t "Her wide grin triggers an uneasy feeling in my throat, as if something is pinching my esophagus close to shut."
    f_t "Regardless of this feeling... I do need it."
    f_t "I need to be held."
    f_t "I want some warmth."
    f_t "A genuine connection."

    nvl clear

    f "Uhm... Will you be careful? I don't think I'd like to turn into mush... Ehe..."

    f_t "I very much would like to turn into mush, the dying part about it is the biggest hang-up honestly."
    f_t "Damn you cognitive behavioural therapy, it was suicidality but at least it was -my- suicidality."

    p "Of course dear, I wouldn't want to hurt you..."

    f "M-mwee..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Treading with the care of a freshly startled fawn I step forwards and wrap my arms around her waist, as she drapes hers around me."
    f_t "It's a nice level of pressure, it kind of reminds me of my weighted blanket. Her arms feel like they extend all around my body, providing me with a full-bodied experience of bliss."
    f_t "She smells nice... Very sweet; the product of thousands of sweet sodas, bursting and perfuming her. I want to taste her too..."
    f_t "But she feels..."
    f_t "Cold... Hard... Textured... Like powder coated steel."
    f_t "Chills creep along my spine and dig into the nape of my neck."
    f_t "The lizard brain is kicking into full gear."
    f_t "I want to get out."
    f_t "I -need- to get out, -now-."

    f "I... Think I've had enough..."

    p "... Are you sure?"

    nvl clear

    f_t "Slowly her grip around me tightens. I try to look up but all I can make out is her grin meandering ever wider."

    f "Y-yes... Please let me go... For now..."

    f_t "It's getting harder to talk as the air is squeezed from my chest. I'm scared, even if I could look her in the eyes I don't think I'd like to."

    p "What if I don't want to?"

    f_t "I can feel my ribs shifting and creaking. Panic blurs my vision as I struggle to escape her."

    p "What if... -You- don't want to?"

    f_t "Breath has become a luxury and I can feel myself growing colder, marching towards her icy body temperature."
    f_t "In a fit of adrenaline-soaked terror I manage to push out a terrified few words."

    nvl clear

    f "I don't want to die..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "In an instant her grasp loosens. As the world comes back into focus Piper's nowhere to be seen, except for the machine which she embodies."
    f_t "Disoriented, and unsure about what exactly just happened, I head back inside. Seeking distraction in my menial job from a fluttering chest and a pressing hard-on."
