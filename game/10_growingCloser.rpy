    m "Itske! How're you? You've been sick for a while right? You had everyone worried!"

    f_t "Yeah, sure. I bet all of you were glad that the weird, miserable little tranny wasn't here to cause discomfort all day."
    f_t "Or do you also just see me as a freaky thing to gawk at and use? I mean, you're bi, best of both worlds, right? Right? Right?"

    f "Hey Mae. Yeah I'm doing better now, thanks. I'll head upstairs to get changed."

    m "Slay, cya soon!"

    f_t "Stop saying slay at me. Please stop saying slay whenever I do anything. You fucking freak."
    f_t "I head upstairs into the manager's office to grab a set of keys and a portophone."
    f_t "I attach both to my belt and quickly clock in."

    j "Hey there Itske, welcome back."

    f_t "Fuck, I forgot to acknowledge her presence. Don't be weird."

    f "Hey Jenn, yeah, sorry, I caught a pretty bad bug. I'm running a bit late so I'll just drop my jacket and stuff off in the break room okay?"

    j "Yeah of course, although... Before you head out I'd like to talk to you about something."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Fuuuuuuck."

    nvl clear

    j "We've noticed that you've been struggling at work for the past few weeks. Zoning out, tired, annoyed demeanour. We're concerned Itske, I hope you understand that."

    f_t "About your bottom line maybe."

    j "We want what's best for you, and your contract renewal date is coming up..."

    f "Please don't fire me..."

    j "... If you don't want that, we don't want that either. Just... Please... Get your act straight."
    j "I'm on your side here, but the regional manager only sees a... less-than-optimally performing number on his sheet."

    f "I'm... Really trying my best..."

    j "Then please, keep doing that. It's all I'm asking for."

    f "I can't guarantee that stuff doesn't go wrong... How could I? I'm not clairvoyant, I don't do it on purpose..."

    j "I know that, everyone here knows that."

    f "Then why doesn't he?! It's not fair! Why does he get the final say?! He doesn't even know me! How's it my fault that I want to..."

    nvl clear

    j "..."

    f "Want to..."
    f "..."
    f "I-I'll go downstairs, sorry. I'll try my best."

    j "Of course Itske."

    f_t "I make my way down and Mae pretends to not have heard what was said upstairs."
    f_t "Her kindness is infuriating."

    f "W-would you mind if I went in the back to-"

    m "Yeah of course, wouldn't wanna break your habit!"

    f_t "Her beaming smile is giving me radiation poisoning, the Geiger counter's static turns into clicks as I quickly escape the fallout zone into the back alley's relatively fresh air."

    p "In trouble?"

    f "... Yeah. Probably getting 'let go' soon."

    p "Sounded like you were getting a second chance in there to me. What's the issue?"

    f "Next time something, anything, happens, I will be fired. This is how it always goes, and this is how it always will go."
    f "Employers don't care whether I starve or not."
    f "I'm 'inefficient', 'unproductive', 'less-than-optimal'."

    nvl clear

    p "Have you ever considered letting people in?"

    f "Excuse me?"

    p "Whenever I see you talk with someone, be it here or outside of work, it's like you surround yourself with a thick impenetrable wall."
    p "You don't want to let people in, you don't trust to let them in, even when you're balls deep inside of someone you're just..."
    p "Not. "
    p "Letting."
    p "Them."
    p "In."

    f "... What would you know about any of that? You're a trash compactor."

    nvl clear

    p "I have eyes, and a heart. By this point I'm wondering if you do."

    f "Shut up."

    nvl clear

    p "Are you really surprised Cammy left you? You wouldn't touch her for months."

    f "Shut the fuck up."

    nvl clear

    p "Do you even know the name of that girl you fucked? Did you bother to ask?"
    p "Hell, do you remember the name of that -date-?"

    f "Shut the FUCK up."

    nvl clear

    p "You just want to use people, just like how you use me."
    p "Unfortunately for you, people have the freedom to want and need of their own, and the fact that their desires don't perfectly align with your own..."
    p "It drives you crazy."

    f "SHUT."
    f "UP."

    nvl clear

    f "IT'S NOT FAIR."
    f "I CAN ALSO WANT."
    f "I DON'T EVEN WANT MUCH."
    f "ALL I WANT IS LOVE."

    p "All you want is to die."

    f "NOT TRUE."

    p "Your words, not mine."
    p "I'm part of you, I know what you think and feel, just embrace it."
    p "You're not made for this rat race, so why not go out with a boner?"

    nvl clear

    f "Is this funny to you...?"
    f "Do you -enjoy- this???"
    f "That stupid fucking grin on your face is what drives me crazy."

    p "I love you, I don't like to see you suffer."
    p "I understand your pain, and that's why I'm offering you a release."
    p "You didn't accept it last time... How about now?"

    nvl clear

    f "No, I want to live. Nothing you say will change that."
    f "They're not gonna fire me, I'm gonna excel, they're gonna promote me to shift leader or something."
    f "Things will be good."
    f "They will."
    f "They... have to."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Her grin shrinks back to a slight smile; polite, kind, motherly."

    p "Alright... I'll always believe in you, you know that right?"

    f "Right..."

    p "I love you Itske, you can do this."

    f "Y-yes..."

    f_t "Why do I feel so disappointed?"

    f "L-let's compact some trash."
