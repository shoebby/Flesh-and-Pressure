    f_t "Okay let's see... that's 67 slats on the blinds..."
    f_t "143 pleats on the curtains..."
    f_t "352 collective beads on my kandi bracelets..."
    f_t "87 floor boards..."
    f_t "What can I count next today? What time is it? Only 1 PM? That's a lot of time left in the day..."
    f_t "I can't really count a popcorn wall can I?"

    f_t "I look over to the single exposed brick wall in my bedroom."
    f_t "I guess the landlord thought it'd be cool and rustic."
    f_t "A perfect candidate for counting."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Counting helps to keep my mind occupied which, in turn, keeps me from using or drinking."
    f_t "A therapist taught me this method, I can't remember which one."
    f_t "Maybe the chill Spanish bisexual lady? Or the Freud guy with the tiger-patched blazer and bolo ties?"
    f_t "Urgh, he was such an asshole. Thank god I'm out of that ward. He was like House if House was an -actual- asshole."
    f_t "Where was I?"
    f_t "Oh yeah, bricks."

    f_t "I shove my bed away from the wall and am confronted by a colony of dust bunnies, whose peace I so cruelly disrupted."
    f_t "It was a necessary cruelty however, because this way I can count the wall's number of bricks in its entirety. This should take a good amount of time, I'll survive another day without caving to the horrors!"
    f_t "I've been 'sick' for the past week now, I haven't left the house yet and work is starting to ask questions about when I'll feel ready to return to work."
    f_t "They took me out of the schedule as well so I'll only be paid for a contracted 5 hours per week, cheap bastards."
    f_t "Truth of the matter is I can't go into work. I don't know how to explain it I just... -can't-."
    f_t "When this mental block is up I simply can't break through it for a while, so it's best to just get comfortable, stay put, and try my best to not waste away too much."
    f_t "Honestly, I'm still mentally coherent, I'm still able to get up to go to the bathroom when I need to, I've been able to feed myself the bits and pieces of food left over in my cupboards, relatively speaking I'm doing pretty well."
    f_t "I just can't go outside."
    f_t "Whatever the case is, I can -not- go outside."

    f_t "How much is it to ask for someone to come into my life, willing to genuinely, completely, whole-heartedly connect with me?"
    f_t "Why do they always need to be lured in with sex?"
    f_t "Am I not good enough for that?"
    f_t "Is that all I'm good for?"
    f_t "Am I just a sex doll?"

    f_t "Who the fuck leaves, right after their hookup, at 2am? {color=#f00}I want to die{/color}"
    f_t "If anything -that's- dangerous, being alone that late at night."
    f_t "It's not like she had reason to leave as soon as possible... Right?"
    f_t "I didn't make her uncomfortable... Right?"
    f_t "I'm not dangerous... Right?"

    f "... Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty... Forty-one..."

    f_t "Not to mention that horrible date."
    f_t "It was so fucking awkward."
    f_t "If she didn't like midg-{w=0.5}minigolf, then why did she say yes?"
    f_t "It's like she did everything in her power to make me feel weird and uncomfortable."
    f_t "Like, she made me cry!"
    f_t "The least she could've done is let me down easy and not abandon me there, I want to die it's not my fault {color=#f00}I want to die{/color} have the hand-eye coordination of a newborn fawn..."

    f_t "Work for 6 days a week 8 hours a day just to make ends meet."
    f_t "{color=#f00}I want to die{/color} I can't even save up much of anything, let alone take care of myself or my apartment..."
    f_t "I'm just in constant motion, constant tension, never easing up, never letting go..."
