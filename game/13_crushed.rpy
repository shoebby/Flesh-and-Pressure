    f_t "Well... That's it. My last shift and I still haven't found a new job. After this I have about... 4 weeks until I'll be kicked out of my apartment."
    f_t "I flick open my phone to check... Not a single email or call back, except for a notification on new job listings."

    f_t "Bus driver... I can't drive..."
    f_t "Retail... You guys already fired me..."
    f_t "Mail room clerk... Apply..."
    f_t "Security... Hmmm... I did break his nose..."
    f_t "Hmmm... Apply..."
    f_t "Ministry of defence... Over my dead body..."

    f_t "She appears above me as per usual, on the grate walkway."

    f "Didn't ask for your opinion."

    f_t "Her steps ring down on me like clattering cutlery. It used to be a soothing song, but now it only frustrates and terrifies."
    f_t "It makes me feel sick, her overwhelming presence, her gravity. She's pulling me in, trying to at least, to hold me and never let go."

    p "You don't have to ask, I know you crave it. I know you crave -me-."

    f_t "I want her to turn me into unliving unfeeling meat."

    nvl clear

    f "W-what happened to that \"ouuhh I believe in you\" shtick? Got bored? Lost interest?"

    p "False hope makes you taste better, and by now it should've long dawned on you that it's a lost cause..."

    f_t "The words leave her lips covered in a viscous layer of disgust."
    f_t "No matter how much or how hard I shake them around in my head they don't get any kinder, any more understanding, any less slimy."
    f_t "Her pity has run out."

    nvl clear

    p "... And yet my feelings for you haven't changed. I love you. Not to mention, this is our last night working together."

    f "I... I can bounce back from this. I've been in worse situations."

    p "Why would you want to do that to yourself all over again?"

    f_t "Straight through the heart. She's right, I don't want to... I -can't- ever be like that again."
    f_t "Something about it breaks your brain, this chronic fear of invasion in all of its forms."
    f_t "Who can say what it will do to me next?"

    nvl clear

    p "All I'm offering is a way out."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Her beautiful frame opens up, arms hissing air, fingers unfurling their arrays of knuckles."

    p "A blissful one at that."

    f "... I'm scared."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Piper sighs, steam escapes between her teeth."

    p "When aren't you scared? You've said it before yourself, to yourself, countless times: do it scared."

    f "C-can I just get a regular hug? Please?"

    p "The only thing I can give you at this point is the full thing, the real deal. If you're not ready for that, stop wasting my time and get back to your last hours of employment."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Her harsh words make me chub up a little, red-hot tears burn as they bathe in the white of my eyes."

    f "Y-you don't get it, I... hic... I can't give up..."

    f_t "Her presence crushes me."

    p "You keep saying that, but who or what are you living for? No friends, no partners, no important work, no hobbies, what's your reason?"

    f "S-sniff... Juh-just people... In general... I -do- have friends... A-and my parents... I promised..."

    p "What, those people online who sometimes reply to your messages? Is your brain -that- broken, that you consider those people your friends?"

    f "..."

    p "And your parents... That promise died with them disowning you, they detest you."

    f "..."

    p "You're completely and utterly alone, you're terrified."

    f "... Yeah."

    nvl clear

    p "You want to know why you've ended up alone like this?"

    f "C-chance...?"

    p "Wrong, incorrect, and you know the real reason, because I also know why."

    f "... W-wa-{nw}"

    nvl clear

    p "Her birthday."
    p "Your anniversary."

    nvl clear

    p "She didn't leave you over a lack of sex, numbskull. She left because you gave every indication that you did not care about her in the slightest."
    p "No, instead of spending time with her you went to meet up with strangers from the internet, and did things with them you've barely grown to admit to yourself."
    p "Honestly, that's your real preference; people you've just met."
    p "The intoxicating, exotic eroticism of a stranger, barely real people in your eyes, you desire them and their approval the most."
    p "They don't take up your precious space, don't eat away at your precious time; they don't want, they don't -need-, they're dial-up affection from a supposed objective source."

    f "...I-I'm so-{nw}"

    nvl clear

    p "Really, the only person you seem able to stand is yourself, and you HATE yourself, so that says something doesn't it?"
    p "Although... Is it -hate- you feel, or rather self-obsession?"
    p "You are habitually talking to yourself after all, are you really that interesting?"

    f_t "Are you angry now, or do you feel kinship?"
    f_t "Do you feel loved?"
    f_t "Is my voice soothing?"
    f_t "Do you want me to jerk you off?"
    f_t "Do you want to hatefuck my throat?"

    p "Do you -really- want to die, or do you want to reach a state of being where there's nothing beyond -you-?"

    nvl clear

    f_t "Maybe death is the quiet room to yourself, a hyperbolic time chamber; A space where nothing happens and no one disturbs unless you wish it so, doesn't that sound nice?"

    p "I don't care how you think it -sounds-, I know that it's exactly what you -want-."

    f "... Maybe what I want isn't what I need."

    p "Seriously? You've been impulsive all your life, going off of what you -want- has been your default setting for the past 25 years."

    p "Like, ugh, fucks sake, you've let people do unspeakable things to you just cause you thought it -might- be hot. You KNOW this is really fucking hot, you KNOW you want this."

    p "What's that? Trash says what?"

    f "S-stopp..."

    p "I didn't know trash could talk, trash is just there to get crushed and thrown away. Trash isn't missed by anyone, trash is discarded and left to rot with all the other trash."

    f_t "I take a trembling step forward."

    p "Is trash coming to its senses? Is trash finally realizing that this is the only thing it deserves?"

    f_t "Another step, teardrops darken specks of concrete."

    p "Is trash ready...?"

    f_t "Her arms scream as they wrap and close around me, my own limbs tightly pressed to my chest."
    f_t "For a moment it feels nice, the blanketing slight pressure, but the force on my body increases with every moment."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "My own arms press the air out of my lungs, it quickly becomes hard to breathe and I can feel... hear my spine popping."
    f_t "Her steady whine climbs a few notes as she encounters her first, major obstacle in my ribcage. At first it gave, but its flex has long since maxed out."
    f_t "My skin bruises, the flesh shifts and tears in places, but the frame of my chest remains resolute."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "I can still feel the pressure increase, it hurts so good when, finally, my ribs begin to give out one by one."
    f_t "A crack here, a pop there. With every sound the others grow weaker as their workload quickly becomes unbearable, until they all might as well be powder."
    f_t "Shards of bone drive themselves into my lungs, liver, heart. I start hacking up blood."
    f_t "By this point I am already as good as dead, choking on my own viscera as my consciousness struggles to remain, so that I may experience her cruelty in full."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "I feel my shoulders pop out of their sockets, rolling and shifting inside of my body, wreaking havoc on my delicate meat."
    f_t "Tendons tear, bones fracture, muscle fibers rip, organs collapse, until her pressure finally reaches my skull."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "Drifting in and out of consciousness, it's a miracle I can still think, feel, enjoy."
    f_t "The skull is strong, it tries to hold its own against her onslaught."
    f_t "The pressure builds up, it hurts, an incredible headache crackles through my brain."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "My cheek bones give out and drive themselves further into my eye sockets. The growing pressure pushes behind my eyes."
    f_t "The pain has long since blinded me, and when they pop from their sockets I do not feel or sense a thing beyond the wet slap with which they hit my face."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "My jaw splits, with a clean snap I get the mandibles of an insect, housed by loose shifting flesh."
    f_t "Teeth sit loosely, I lick a few of them out from their sockets, chittering in my mouth like beetles."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "I can feel my palate separate. First the lining, then the bone, shifting, cracking, pulling apart."
    f_t "My tongue is drip-fed dribbles of seeping brain fluid; salty, slightly metallic, I never knew."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."

    f_t "Her whine grows, the fault lines of my skull creak and struggle to remain in place, until finally..."
    f_t "They too, buckle to her cruel pressure."
