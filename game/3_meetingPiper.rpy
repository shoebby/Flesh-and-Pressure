    t "-and honestly bitcoin is way overhyped by this point, I don't think it's worth investing in. Stuff's just too stable to get me -really- excited, y'know?"

    f "Uhuh..."

    f_t "I swear to god if he starts talking about NFTs I'm going to break his spine."

    t "-what's been really exciting lately? These things called NFTs-"

    f_t "Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-{nw}"

    f "Heyyy, Tom, are there any tasks that still need to be done today? I'm really itching to like, do something."

    t "Assertive, nice! Real go-getter stuff. I guess you could compact the trash, we've gotta wheel them out in front today so if it was 3 bins instead of like 6 that'd be a huge help."

    f "We have a way of compacting trash?"

    t "You never noticed it? It's out back! I can show it to you real quick."

    f_t "Through the heavy emergency back exit we enter the small outside area behind the cinema."
    f_t "It's grown quite familiar to me so far, it's the only place where I can go and smoke during my breaks."
    f_t "By extension, also -during- my shifts whenever I'm 'sweeping' out back."

    t "Here she is! We call her Piper, cause of the-"

    f "Big pipe on the top?"

    t "Exactly!"

    f "Heheh..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "The machine is close to pristine."
    f_t "The cobalt blue powder coating remains undamaged despite the hundreds of wheelie bins that have been rammed into her."
    f_t "My god, even her hazard stickers are intact."
    f_t "Her function seems intuitive; a big disc moves down by piston action and presses the trash in the bin down, pushing the air out and creating space for more bags."
    f_t "The sequence of inputs had to be told to me though."
    f_t "Press and hold down the button, pull the lever, let it compress, wait for her to whine, push the lever, release the button."
    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."
    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."
    f_t "This... Has something to it."

    nvl clear

    t "-And that's how you do it! You got it from here?"

    f "A-ah yes I think so, thanks."

    f_t "Being left alone with her gives me the time to appreciate her finer features."
    f_t "The design and engineering behind her body, the snappy, tactile inputs, the noises she makes..."
    f_t "It's hard to pick up, but when flipping her switch she starts purring, very quietly."
    f_t "It's anticipatory, her attempt at withholding her excitement..."
    f_t "Waiting..."
    f_t "Turned on..."

    f "W-waah... Well that's 1 bin down... I think I could do some more..."

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."
    f_t "The lever's a nice hard-plastic handle, ribbed for grip, letting me grab a hold of her firmly; would she like it?"
    f_t "Something beautiful about her are the bits of green moss growing on top of her pressing disc."
    f_t "It's funny to think of it as being her bush."
    f_t "Hehe..."
    f_t "Yeah..."
    f_t "Funny..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."
    f_t "She's incredible."
    f_t "Thanks to her one wheelie bin can fit about 8 trash bags, each full of plastic bottles, packaging, bits of food, and carton popcorn boxes."
    f_t "Each piece of trash makes their own set of sounds when they get pressed; they crackle, pop, or sometimes even squelch."
    f_t "When a bag is tightly closed it forms a growing air bubble while it's being compressed, tension builds and builds until it snaps open with a satisfying pop."
    f_t "I'm starting to understand why my aunt keeps watching those pimple popping videos."
    f_t "Still gross though."

    f "This is so... Fun..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "Press. Pull. Compress. Whine. Push. Release."
    f_t "My hands have gone clammy and I can feel beads of sweat roll down my cheeks."
    f_t "I think this is turning me on, but I'm not getting hard, and I'm not exactly sure -what- about this is turning me on so much."
    f_t "Is it pulling and pushing the handle?"
    f_t "No..."
    f_t "It's something about the sounds."
    f_t "The cracking, the squeezing, it's kind of like..."

    f "Bones... Meat... Organs..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "I've never done something like this, I've done slapping, punching, cutting, but nothing that... Genuinely would break me."
    f_t "I guess I did jerk off while watching Crash (1996)."
    f_t "Do I... Want to get Crash (1996)'d?"

    f "I think I might want to get Crash (1996)'d..."

    t "Hey Itske, you almost done?{nw}"

    f "WAH!"

    t "Lol, still skittish?"

    f_t "Only around guys who say 'lol' out loud."

    f "Y-yeah, a bit. But it's a lot less compared to when I started here."

    t "That's good! I got it from here, you should go have your break remember?"

    f_t "Ah damnit."

    f "O-oh, okay. Yeah. I'll do that. Thanks."

    nvl clear

    f_t "I shuffle away to the break room, her whirring and whining growing fainter with every set of doors I walk through."
    f_t "I... Need to... think... about some stuff."
    f_t "I'm glad there's no camera in the break room."
