    show speaker itske scared at portrait
    f_t "Oh fuck he remembers, I know it's psychotic to pretend like you're still dating your ex but it made things a bit easier while working here."

    show speaker itske pouting at portrait

    show speaker itske thinking at portrait

    show speaker itske disgust at portrait

    show speaker itske disgust at portrait
    f_t "Oh my god shut up you've had like 2 relationships and they both violently imploded, and hookups do NOT count as relevant dating experience."

    show speaker tom neutral at portrait

    show speaker itske smug at portrait

    show speaker itske pouting at portrait

    show speaker itske smiling at portrait

    show speaker itske forcedsmile at portrait
