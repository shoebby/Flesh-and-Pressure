    t "Dating is so hard..."

    f "Mh? How so?"

    t "Girls are so confusing! It's like they have all these expectations, and they don't say any of them out loud, you kinda just have to guess all he time."

    f_t "Okay, if I don't do something now there's a major chance he will turn into either an incel or a manosphere weirdo."

    t "I've been on dating apps, done a bunch of texting, but it never seems to turn into a date... Like, you have a girlfriend right?"

    f "Errr..."

    f_t "Such horrible timing for a conversation like this, right after yesterday's mess."
    f_t "She didn't block me but with how cold and distant she is now I kinda wish she did."
    f_t "Whatever, fucking chaser."

    nvl clear

    f "No... We broke up, like a week into when I started here."

    f_t "Maybe I should text her again? But that'd be double-texting... People don't like that as far as I've picked up."
    f_t "Comes off as desperate?"
    f_t "But what if you have two things to say?"
    f_t "I hate that this guy is like 10\% right, it -is- complicated."

    t "Oh, weird, I thought I heard you talk about her recently."

    f_t "Oh fuck he remembers, I know it's psychotic to pretend like you're still dating your ex but it made things a bit easier while working here."
    f_t "There's no shame in that, right?"

    f "Y-you must've misremembered."

    nvl clear

    t "I guess so. It's crazy to think it's already been like what, 3 months since you started working here?"
    t "Time really flies."

    f_t "I've been working here for that long?"
    f_t "I didn't realize but this is somehow now contending with the strip bar gig for longest held job."
    f_t "And I had a sweet gimmick there! I have no gimmick here at all! Except for my trash-compacting I guess."
    f_t "Why haven't they fired me yet?"
    f_t "Has anything happened that would be fireable so far?"
    f_t "No... I guess not, but it's not like that was a requirement in the past."
    f_t "At some places it just took a wrong glance at a customer; I understand my resting bitch face isn't exactly working to my benefit, but it's always felt..."
    f_t "Unfair..."

    nvl clear

    f "Yeah... H-hah, it sure does."

    f_t "Change the subject before you start crying, you baby."

    f "H-hey! Maybe you could run your date ideas by me, I'm pretty -experienced- when it comes to women... Hehe..."

    f_t "Oh my god shut up you've had like 2 relationships and they both violently imploded, and hookups do NOT count as relevant dating experience."

    t "Oh! Sure! Alright so I was thinking, for this girl I've been texting with for a while, she -really- likes anime, do you know wha-"

    f_t "My sagely nodding cues him into the fact that I am also a disgusting weeb. I even have my arms crossed, it's like the full picture."

    t "Well I figured, why not take her out to karaoke?"

    f_t "This is an incredible idea."

    t "I think I'd like your perspective on this cause she's trans as well-"

    f_t "This is a-"

    f "HORRIBLE idea."

    nvl clear

    t "Oh god is it?"

    f "99\% chance it is. Even if she went through with it there's a major chance she breaks down crying halfway through her first performance-{nw}"

    f_t "Wow, projecting much?{nw}"

    f "-and at that point it'll just be over."

    t "Okay... So what sort of date ideas do you suggest?"

    f "Well it depends y'know? You've gotta know what they like and it mostly hinges on that."
    f "You already applied that really well but it should just be something else in that general direction y'know?"
    f "Depending on the person even minigolf could be a good date idea"

    t "Haha, so I take it you don't like midgetgolf?"

    f "I hate it. Also don't call it that, it's kinda ableist."

    t "O-okay... Then... What should I do? Any ideas?"
