    f_t "My keys clatter as I toss them on the metal hallway ledge."
    f_t "I messed up my throw and I brace myself as the weight of the carabiner pulls the rest of the bunch down over the edge."

    f "Ack! Loud..."

    f_t "I place them down carefully, a deep sigh leaves my chest as the weight of today's workday droops off of my shoulders."
    f_t "It'd hit the ground with a wet splat if it could."
    f_t "My second week already... Training has been hectic, they gave me a thick booklet of checklists to walk through during my first two days."
    f_t "Mae was my trainer for both days, very kind, kind of plain, surprisingly passionate about her work there."
    f_t "Actually, most if not all of my coworkers seem to genuinely care a lot..."
    f_t "About the customers, their coworkers, the cinema, I haven't seen this anywhere before."
    f_t "Usually people just bullshit and half-ass these sorts of jobs. It almost makes me care as well."
    f_t "Maybe it will?"
    f_t "I don't know."
    f_t "It's probably mostly thanks to Jenn, she's a good manager..."
    f_t "Really nice..."
    f_t "Pretty..."

    f "E-eheheh..."

    f_t "These days have been good but tiring and... Educational."
    f_t "I never knew what people did in the dark of a theater hall, and now I wish it stayed that way."
    f_t "Terrifying 'Barbenheimer' stories, loveseat blowjobs caught live, and the floors there have seen just about every substance a human body can produce."
    f_t "Some of them hot, most of them... Not so much..."
    f_t "Whatever, I'm free tomorrow, I should focus on enjoying myself."

    f "I'm ho-... Oh, yeah."

    f_t "I guess she left during my shift today."
    f_t "Her iconic butterfly suitcase is no longer in the hall and our..."
    f_t "my... display cabinet is now half-empty."
    f_t "I shake off my coat and pull off my shoes."
    f_t "No one's here to reprimand me about not taking them off anymore, but habits stick."
    f_t "It's for the better, I mop like once a year at best."

    f "So dark..."

    f_t "I throw on the hallway lights and then move on to the living room ones."
    f_t "Standing paper guy, standing Pixar guy, standing three-headed guy."
    f_t "Finally, with the kitchen lights on, I start feeling more at ease and throw a look at the oven's clock."

    f "2:23 AM... But deduct an hour... Cause of the uh, thing... 1:23 AM..."

    f_t "I could try to sleep already, but I really don't want to."
    f_t "Sleeping is wasting time, I could spend that time doing fun stuff!"
    f_t "Walking over to the apartment's crafts corner I flick on the light switch and look around."
    f_t "Now that I have time to -myself- finally, I can do all the things I've been wanting to do!"

    f "Although... Hmm... Sold the Lego... Ran out of unbuilt plamo kits..."
    f "Ah!!! I could play some games from my backlog."

    f_t "Hopping over to my now lonely desk I turn my computer on and boot up Steam, scrolling through my library..."
    f_t "Scrolling..."
    f_t "Until something catches my eye..."
    f_t "Scrolling..."
    f_t "Scrolling..."
    f_t "Scrolling..."

    f "..."

    f_t "With heavy reluctance I boot up the Feed The Beast launcher and start playing the same modpack I've been playing for the past half-decade."

    f "New world... Survival... Hard... World type default..."

    f_t "It's going pretty well this time around. Before long I even got a fully automated setup going for processing ores!"
    f_t "Time flies as my eyes grow heavier and bloodshot. I inevitably get stuck with a tech automation problem, like always."

    f "Hey Cammy do you know how to-"
    f "...Oh."
    f "I... Forgot, again."
    f "..."

    f_t "Damnit damnit damnit damnit my eyes are burning, I can't do this it hurts too much."
    f_t "Always feeling too much, always been my issue."
    f_t "I should just head to bed, tomorrow I'll feel better, for sure."
    f_t "I turn off my PC, turn off the kitchen lights, turn off the living room lights, turn off the hallway lights..."
    f_t "The dark has now taken hold of me, my eyes slowly acclimate to it but an uneasy feeling fills my throat like bile."
    f_t "I speedwalk to the bedroom and quickly close the door behind me, looking away from the dark beyond as I do so; afraid to catch a glimpse of something that is not there and cannot exist."
    f_t "I quickly turn on the bedroom light and crawl into the covers."

    f_t "tonight I'll be clutching Bearnard."
    f_t "He's fuzzy, soft, weighty, iridescent."
    f_t "I keep staring at the closed door, every blink a terrifying moment of brief blindness."
    f_t "There's sounds, I could swear I'm hearing sounds."
    f_t "Did the door handle just get pushed down, slightly, just for a split second?"
    f_t "Is that a moving shadow under the door?"

    f "What if I..."

    f_t "I get up and grab a tissue from the box on my bedside table."
    f_t "I crack the door slightly, taking care not to look through the opening."
    f_t "I wedge the tissue in-between the door and its frame, right below the handle and shut it closed."
    f_t "This way, if someone opens the door, the tissue would fall on the floor, which would show me that someone was inside of my room while I was sleeping, so that way I won't be attacked!"

    f_t "Yes."
    f_t "This is sound logic."
    f_t "I think."
    f_t "..."
    f_t "No, that's incredibly stupid, I'd already be murdered."

    f_t "Wait... What did that Tumblr post say again?"
    f_t "Oh right."
    f_t "Masturbating."
    f_t "When you're scared in the dark, jerk off."

    f "Ghh... I hope this helps..."

    f_t "Pulling off the covers I realize I'm still fully dressed in my work uniform."
    f_t "Seems like in my rush I forgot to change into my jammies."

    f "Whoops."
    f "..."
    f "Actually..."

    f_t "I undo my belt, the idea of masturbating while wearing my work uniform is kind of a turn-on."
    f_t "I'm even at a decent chub already."

    f "W-woahg..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "I pull my polo up to my chest, letting it rest above my boobs."
    f_t "I don't wanna risk dirtying it before I get to business, imagine working with a cumstain on your work shirt..."
    f_t "..."
    f_t "nnggh..."
    f_t "Sliding my pants and undies down halfway my thighs my dick perks up, hard but it still feels a bit dry..."

    f "Mh... Must be the nerves..."

    f_t "I turn over onto my chest and lift my hips upwards, presenting myself to the air behind me."

    f "Don't think too much... Just enjoy yourself..."

    f_t "I take the head of my cock in-between my index and middle finger and slowly start massaging it with my thumb."
    f_t "It quickly gets wetter and wetter, strands of slimy precum webbing between my fingers."
    f_t "For some reason this position always feels the best."
    f_t "I don't even know why, I don't even like bottoming."
    f_t "I think."

    f "Ahng... Fuck, that feels good... I needed this..."

    f_t "I catch a nice rhythm, but my thoughts begin to wander."
    f_t "Was that a thud behind me? Above me?"
    f_t "Did the door creak open? I didn't hear anyone walk in, I think?"
    f_t "What if someone is behind me right now, watching?"

    f "Tch..."

    f_t "What if... Jenn was behind me and watching?"

    f "A-ah... Awesome..."

    nvl clear

    f_t "I ride this thought as far as it takes me."
    f_t "Her hands are rough in a very pleasant way, I bet it'd feel amazing to have her grab ahold of me..."
    f_t "She's pretty straight-faced, but I did notice her canines when she laughs."
    f_t "They're large, nice and pointy, what if she bit me..."
    f_t "But eventually this thought is again overtaken by fear and paranoia."
    f_t "I'm alone in this house, I don't know any of my neighbours; if anything happened I'd be totally alone..."
    f_t "No. I can't get sad now, this is me-time."
    f_t "I want to cum!!!"

    nvl clear

    f_t "The Tumblr post also said something about addressing the fears directly, maybe if I try that..."

    f "C-come on... If a-anyone is behind me just f-fuck me already and get it over with!!!"

    f_t "I take the resounding, embarrassing quiet as an answer."
    f_t "The absurdity of the situation takes my mind off of the paranoia and back to a happier place; I can feel myself getting closer."

    f "Hfff..."

    f_t "I push my face into my pillow and bite into it, drool running down my cheek. I want to fuck something so bad."

    f "Nnngh..."

    f_t "I need a rebound, a fuckhole, a pump and dump, I need to get over this breakup."

    f "f-fuckk..."

    f_t "I don't think... I -can't- sleep alone."

    nvl clear

    f "A-ah...!"

    f_t "A few thin ropes shoot onto the bedding. I quiver slightly as a tingling sensation creeps up the base of my cock, and burrows itself into my pelvis."

    f "Huff... Hhaahhh... I really need to get new lecithin capsules... This is embarrassing..."

    f_t "The sad, scary thoughts seem to have left me, I can't really think about anything anymore."
    f_t "It's like I ejaculated a part of my brain."
    f_t "I guess an empty head is nice sometimes."
    f_t "Relieved, and slightly reassured, I plop down into my own cum."
    f_t "Keeping the lights on, still shooting occasional glances at the door, eventually exhaustion overtakes me and I sleep a dreamless night."
